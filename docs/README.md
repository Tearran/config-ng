With these steps, you can create a comprehensive and informative man page that includes usage examples, tutorials, and additional sections. Adjust the content, sections, and formatting according to specific guidelines.

1. **Create Markdown Content:**
   Write the content for your man page in Markdown format, including all the necessary sections, descriptions, usage examples, and tutorials. Make sure to structure the content properly using appropriate Markdown headers (`#`, `##`, `###`, etc.).

   ```markdown
   # ARMBIAN-CONFIG(1) User Manual

   ## NAME

   config - A command line tool for system configuration

   ## SYNOPSIS

   **config** [ -r | Group | option ]

   ## DESCRIPTION

   The `config` command is a command-line tool for system configuration. It provides a range of options for configuring various aspects of the system...

   ## OPTIONS

   - `-h`: Show the help message.
   - `-l`: Show a list of available group options.
   - ...

   ## EXAMPLES

   To see a list of available desktops to install:

   ```shell
   config install see_desktops
   ```

   To enable Infrared Remote Control support:

   config iolocal set_lirc
   ```

   ## SEE ALSO

   ```

2. **Convert Markdown to Man Page:**
   Use `pandoc` to convert the Markdown content into a formatted man page. You can include metadata and specify the output filename:

   ```bash
   pandoc --standalone -t man input.md -o output.1
   ```

3. **Add Additional Sections:**
   For more detailed sections like tutorials, additional usage examples, and tutorials, you can use the standard man page sections and headers. Here's an example of how you can add a "TUTORIALS" section:

   ```markdown
   ## TUTORIALS

4. **Generate the Man Page:**
   Run the `pandoc` command again to generate the man page with the additional sections and tutorials:

   ```bash
   pandoc --standalone -t man input.md -o output.1
   ```

5. **Compress Man Page:**
   If you want to create a compressed man page as `.gz` (common in Debian-based systems), use the `gzip` command:

   ```bash
   gzip output.1
   ```
